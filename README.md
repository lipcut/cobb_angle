# cobb-angle

A toy implementation for article [Yeh, Yu-Cheng, et al. "Deep learning approach for automatic landmark detection and alignment analysis in whole-spine lateral radiographs."](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-87141-x). (WIP, it's kind of broken now.)
Disclaimer: I'm not the author, so please don't contact them when encountering issues. Also, the repo is built for educational purpose, use with care.

## running experiment
first create a virtual environment and install the required packages, then run the train.py in that environment. That should do.
